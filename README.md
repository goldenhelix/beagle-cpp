This is a port of BEAGLE 4.1 to C++/Qt5: https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html

This implementation is provided with commercial support through Golden Helix SVS: http://goldenhelix.com/products/SNP_Variation/Imputation.html

There is a minimal command line runner under impute/cmdtools/imputec.cpp used for testing equivelance with the Java BEAGLE implementation, but not designed to be robust to all inputs. No support is provided for this code-base directly.
