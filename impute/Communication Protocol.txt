COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL BETWEEN THIS IMPUTE LIBRARY AND AN OUTSIDE PROGRAM

This protocol assumes Qt's QDataStream will be used to encode the data
in both directions. This program wraps standard in and standard out in
QFile's, which are used as the I/O devices by the QDataStream, and the
outside program should invoke this library through a QProcess, which
will also be used by QDataStream as the I/O device.

The following outlines the basic overall flow between the outside program and this impute
library. If this library traps an error, it will signal an error and stop.

<- The outside program sends parameters and how many samples are in
   the reference data and the target data.
-> This library responds with an "OK" signal, and possibly with a
   computed best window size.

<- The outside program sends reference sample data, if reference data
   is being used.
-> This library responds with an "OK" signal.

<- The outside program sends target sample data.
-> This library responds with an "OK" signal.

While there is more marker data:
   -> This library asks for another window of data

   If there are both reference and target data:

      While there is more reference data:

         <- The outside program signals that there is further reference (target)
            data immediately forthcoming, possibly indicating the exact
            size of the next chunk.
         <- The outside program sends about 1/10 th of a window's worth of data.
         -> This library responds with an "OK" signal.

      <- The outside program either signals that further data exists
         beyond what has been sent, or alternatively, it signals that
         the end of the data has been reached.

      While this library finds there is possibly a need for more target data (to
         match the reference data already read for this window):

         -> This library signals the possible need for more target data.

         If there is more target data available:

            <- The outside program signals that there is further target data available and
               immediately forthcoming, possibly indicating the exact size
               of the next chunk.
            <- The outside program sends about 1/10 th of a window's
               worth of data, and this library reads that data and
               matches it up with the reference data.

         Else (no further target data actually available):

            <- The outside program signals that there is no further target data.

      -> This library signals that it has enough target data for this window.

   Else (target only):

      While there is more target data:

         <- The outside program signals that there is further target
            data immediately forthcoming, possibly indicating the exact
            size of the next chunk.
         <- The outside program sends about 1/10 th of a window's worth of data.
         -> This library responds with an "OK" signal.

      <- The outside program either signals that further data exists
         beyond what has been sent, or alternatively, it signals that
         the end of the data has been reached.

   While phasing this window:
      -> This library signals progress.

   If the phased results are to be output:

      While there is further phasing data to be output for this window:

         -> This library signals that there is further phased output.
         -> This library sends about 1/10th of a window's worth of phasing data.
         <- The outside program responds with an "OK" signal.

      -> This library signals that there is no further phased output.

   If imputation has been requested:

      While performing imputation on this window:
         -> This library signals progress.

      While there is further imputation data to be output for this window:

         -> This library signals that there is further imputation output.
         -> This library sends about 1/10th of a window's worth of imputation data.
         <- The outside program responds with an "OK" signal.

      -> This library signals that there is no further imputation output.

-> This library signals that it is finished, and stops.
